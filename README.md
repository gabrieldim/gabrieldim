</br> <b> Note: </b> <i> For few repos i used templates for frontend and just took the data from backend, that's why JS is  most commonly used according to GitHub. 
Java is used the most for the projects that i developed. </br> </i> 
### For every repository there is an appropriate README file for the application that I have developed. For some of them there are Javadocs as well. </br> By default, we can attach six repositories, but i found a way to show you more of my apps here:
